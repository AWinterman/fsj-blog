# Europe Bound

--------------

I'm on my way to Europe!

I'm taking a 16 day trip (including travel days) to Romania and Barcelona. The
occasion is my mother's 50th highschool reunion, but we're also taking
advantage of having hopped the Atlantic to spend some time in a city which
neither of us has visitied. It's going to be interesting and a little
uncomfortable, and new and different, but we have the advantage of being
reasonable people, sharing a language with at least some of the locals in each
place we visit, and having a reasonable budget for the trip.

I'm reading the guide book and hanging out with my family and mentally
preparing myself to live out of my backpack for the next couple weeks. Our
itinerary is as follows:

- **May 12**: fly to Budapest, arriving the following morning
- **Evening of May 14**: Leave Budapest for Satu Mare, or Szatmár in Hungarian. 
- **May 17**: Return to Budapest
- **May 19**: Fly to Barcelona
- **May 28th**: Return to Budapest
- **May 29th**: Fly to SFO.

Satu Mare (which apparently means "Big Town" in Romanian), is where my
grandmother was born, and where she and my grandfather raised my mother before
fleeing Ceauşescu and communism in the 1960s.

So there's some adventure ahead, but for now, I'm hanging out with my
grandmother in the California sun shine and taking selfies with my niece:
