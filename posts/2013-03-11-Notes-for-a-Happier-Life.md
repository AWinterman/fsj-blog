# Notes for a Happier Life

I've noticed that over the course of a year I make a number of resolutions,
stick to them for a few months, and then forget about them. This is a log of
those resolutions which I find most satisfying, both in the positive ("Do this
thing"), and the negative ("Don't do this anymore").

### Positives  ###

- 8.5 hours of sleep per night, and a regular sleep schedule.
- Making my own food.
- [Observing my own thoughts](http://zenhabits.net/fundameditate/)
- Exercising every other day.
- Spanish conversations 
- Long term plans.

### Negatives ###

- Sufficient drinks for a hangover
- Unemployment
- Working more than 9 hours in a day.
- Unhealthy food
- Flying

This list will, of course, be updated.
