# Refugees in Malta

I just read an article in a print version of the New York Times (available
[here](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/world/europe/malta-struggles-under-wave-of-african-migrants.html?ref=world))
describing the plight of African immigrants in the small archipelago nation of
the Republic of Malta. Malta is small and dense. It has a population 368,000
people, according to its [Wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta), who squeeze into its 316 square
kilometers at a rate of 1,306 people per square kilometer.  Malta is the
seventh densest nation in the world. After all the unrest in Northern Africa
over the last few months, the Maltese have been flooded with immigrants bound
for the wealth and stability of Europe, many of whom are rescued off of
makeshift boats, starving, thirsty, dirty and poor.

	> Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
	> With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
	> Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
	> A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
	> Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
	> Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
	> Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
	> The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
	> "Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
	> With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
	> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
	> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
	> Send these, the homeless, tempest-ost to me,
	> I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
	> -- The New Collosus, by Emma Lazarus

The Times article described how poorly the Maltese are dealing with this
influx: First they jail illegal immigrants for six months to a year, often in impromptu
prisons made from unconverted aircraft hangars. Then they end up in "open
centers" - little more than collections of cargo cannisters with communal taps
and bathrooms for sanitation - while they look for work. The Times interviewed one plaintive young man:
"We are here, looking for a life."

The Times spent a lot of ink describing the how limited the Maltese
government's resources for deportation and relocation are. They lack embassy
contacts with African countries. Other European nations won't take them. The
Maltese are stuck in a sticky situation with no options which are both moral and
political feasible.

Paint me liberal, but I think the Maltese have been presented with an
unheralded opportunity. Immigrants are motivated by the promise of a better life for
themselves and their families. If given the opportunity they will work hard for
success. Immigrants are *not* the deadbeats of a nation. They had the
motivation,  means, and  wherewithal to evaluate their situation and leave it
for the unknown. They flee corruption or violence.  They tear their roots out
of tougher earth. They are, in a sense, the select of Northern Africa, and even
better, they are heavily invested in making a new life wherever they end up--
They certainly don't want to go back where they came from. So they have no
options but to languish or to work. They are more thankful for these opportunities
than most, and harder working than those who never had to fight for the
societal benefits they enjoy. I think there is a strong argument to be made
that open immigration policies and the resulting concoction of viewpoints,
success strategies, and cultural cross-currents are responsible for making the
United States the economic power house it is today. 

So why aren't the Maltese embracing this glut of human capital? Where are the
entrepreneurs opening up factories with all this cheap and eager labor? From
the Times article, it sounds like the problem is nativist sentiment-- a veiled
form of discrimination which hampers economic development and drives people to
ignore opportunities. Maybe cleverer heads will prevail before the windfall
turns sour, angry, and unruly.
