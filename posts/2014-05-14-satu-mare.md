# Satu Mare

Today we walked around Satu Mare, and I have to say it was depressing. It seems
like nothing has been repaired or renovated since my mother left more than 50
years ago. There are beautiful old buildings just falling down because no one
has had the skill, money, or maybe desire to fix them. 

It made me want to interview people about what their idea of success is, and
what they would do with money if they don't have, or what they do with it if
they have it.

It made me wish for a marshall plan in the early 90s following the fall of
communism, like we had for western Europe after World War II. I suppose with no
opponent to stick our thumb in, magnanimity just wasn't worth it? Or perhaps no
one knew how badly the USSR had left its satelite countries. In any event, my
mother took a bunch of photographs of where she and some of her friends and
family used to live.
