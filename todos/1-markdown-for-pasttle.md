# Private Pastes #
At UA we've been trying to avoid public but anonymous pastebin's, like
gist.github.com, so one of my fellow developers spent a bit of time making out
own simple pastebin, called [pasttle](https://github.com/thekad/pasttle). It'd
be sweet if we added markdown integration to it, given that that's 90% of what
I use github's gists for.
