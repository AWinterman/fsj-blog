It'd be sweet to have a service that expects sms's like: "Thursday: Barbeque
with Earnie", and then inserts the event into a queue displayed on a website,
at the correct time. 

This would be like a calendar app but different in that it doesn't display the
calendar view. It just shows dates/times and the description. This might
require a pretty big mapping from human language to action, but I think people
have actually solved that problem. This would be a pretty thin wrapper.
