# Literature Is Code 

It's my personal blog! It's kinda cool-- backed by
[fsj](https://www.npmjs.org/package/fsj), and of course browserify. The source
is available [here](https://github.com/AWinterman/fsj-blog), (beware: some of
it isn't actually involved in running the site) MIT licensed. You are free to
rock should you choose to do so.

Who am I? I'm [Andrew][selfie] [Winterman][headshot], a javascript engineer at
UrbanAirship looking down the tube at the abyss. If you have nice things to
say, you can contact me at andywinterman at gmail.

If the nice thing you have to say is "Come work for me", then the answer is
"No".
