# Literature Is Code 

---

It's my personal blog! It's kinda cool-- backed by [fsj](npm.im/fsj), and of
course browserify. The source is available
[here](https://github.com/AWinterman/fsj-blog), (beware: some of
it isn't actually involved in running the site) MIT licensed. You are free to
rock should you choose to do so.

Who am I? I'm a javascript engineer at UrbanAirship looking down the tube at
the abyss. If you have nice things to say, you can contact me at andywinterman
at gmail.

If the nice thing you have to say is "Come work for me", then the answer is
"No".
